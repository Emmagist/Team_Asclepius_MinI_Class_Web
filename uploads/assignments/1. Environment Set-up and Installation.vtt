00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
Hello everyone and welcome to the environment set up lecture and this lecture we're going to go over

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.200
how to get everything that you need onto your computer setup.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.540
This course is going to use Jupiter notebooks for teaching and the notes.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.630
However keep in mind that if you're an experienced Python user you are free to use whatever development

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.150
environment you prefer whether it's pie charm a text editor such as Sublime Text that or no pet plus

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.180
plus whatever you prefer.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.590
It will work for you.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.770
All the notes can be downloaded as py files that are compatible with any Python.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.380
Integrated Development Environment or id or texture.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.910
So if you prefer to use something that's not the Jupiter notebook's feel free to do so.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.190
Go ahead and check out either the fake Q or the lecture.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.020
Jupiter notebooks for the resource download link for this zip file that contains all that you Pernod

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.110
books for the course.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.170
Now let's go ahead and move on to the actual setting up.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.120
We're going to be using the latest version of Python 3 for this course through the Anaconda distribution

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.600
.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.760
All notes and syntax however are compatible with Python too so you can use whatever version you prefer

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.880
.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.050
The syntax for all the libraries are going to be learning is essentially the same for both versions

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.320
.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.940
Let's go ahead and go over the installation options for the Jupiter notebook's system.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.150
If you're an experienced user already has Python on their computer you may wish to install Jupiter using

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.710
Python's package manager Pipp instead of Anaconda.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450
Just go ahead and go to your command prompt.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.090
If you're a Windows user you can just type in CND to find it.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.070
Or if you're a Mac user you can just go to your terminal and use Pip's 3 install Jupiter or Pipp install

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.630
Jupiter.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.800
Depending on what version of python you have again you can just install Jupiter through a quick and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.270
easy Pipp install.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.500
Now if you're a new user it's highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020
Anaconda is a full distribution of Python that conveniently installs Python.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.920
The Jupiter notebook and a bunch of the other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920
science there were going to be using in this course that you can install everything at once.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.210
Let's go ahead and go to w w w that Jupiter or to walk through the installation steps.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.930
OK I'm going to go ahead and jump to my browser and go to this Web site.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.060
I advise you to do the same so you can follow along with the installation procedure.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.390
OK here I am at Jupiter dot org.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.680
That's J U P white TTR org.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.420
And this is the official documentation page for the Jupiter notebook.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.070
Jupiter note book has an open source interactive data science and scientific computing platform that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.170
can work actually across.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.950
Over 40 programming languages.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.940
Not just Python.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.910
It's a really slick web application that actually allows you to create insured documents that contain

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.530
not just life code but equations visualizations and explanatory text.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.400
That's why it's a really great tool for teaching data science and Python libraries.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.940
I want you to scroll down on this page to see the ready to get started and then I want you to click

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.980
on try in your browser and that should take you to this page.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550
Try Jupiter.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.290
Org.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.230
And this is essentially a hosted online version of Jupiter.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.310
We're not going to be using an online version.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.200
We'll show you how to download everything locally.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.590
But I just wanted you to know that this is an option for you in case you ever want to quickly just jump

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.620
to a browser and start working on Jupiter when you actually download Jupiter and have it on your computer

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.440
and run it you'll get something that looks similar to this and then to start a new notebook you can

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.940
click here on NEW AND YOU SHOULD SEE text file folder terminal and then some notebook options.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.560
Now you're not going to have all these options on your computer.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.630
Most likely you'll just have the option Python to Python 3 or Python roots.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.710
One of those most likely it's going to just be Python roots.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.160
You can go ahead and then click on one of these and it'll create a new notebook and then you can go

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.370
ahead and start typing in Python code such as Prince.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.670
Hello.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.410
Run this cell and it should all be working.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.190
Now we'll go over in a future lecture.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.930
How Jupiter notebooks actually work how to run cells etc. how to actually manage the environment.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600
But for now I just wanted you to know about Tricot Jupiter the.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.930
Going back to Jupiter.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.790
Or let's go ahead and install the notebook.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.950
Go ahead and click here on install the notebook and it will take you to this link right here.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.670
The Jupiter documentation page.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.730
Installing a Jupiter note book.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.330
Now Jupiter runs code in many programming languages.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.930
What we're going to be using it for is Python and what we're going to do is use the Anaconda distribution

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.960
in order to install a Jupiter note notebook.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.640
So if you go ahead and kind of zoom in here you'll see that installing Jupiter using Anaconda and Khanda

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.600
like I mentioned for new users.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.870
It's highly recommended that you install Anaconda Anaconda conveniently installs everything for you

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.180
.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.710
What you're going gonna go ahead and do is just follow these three installation steps.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.910
It's really simple.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.810
You're going to just download Anaconda.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.930
So good and click that link.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.280
Then you can install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded and then once you've installed the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.690
Jupiter notebook to run the notebook either go to your command prompt or your terminal and you just

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.020
typed Jupiter space notebook.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.590
Let me go ahead and show you what they Anaconda link looks like.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.390
It looks something like this.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.440
And you'll notice that there's a couple of options for you.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.080
It says download Anaconda now and there's basically a download for Windows Mac users or Linux users

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.520
that will just take you over here to the actual download page.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.490
So if you're downloading for windows go ahead and click on Python 3.5 and depending on what kind of

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.390
computer you have either a 64 bit or 32 bit.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.880
If it's on your computer most likely you have 64 bit.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.520
You can just go ahead and click on this installer or if you're using Mac OS go ahead and just click

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.190
on the graphical installer for Mac OS.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.650
There is also a command line installer but I would really recommend just doing the easy graphic installer

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.300
method.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.570
All you do is down the graphical installer.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.510
Double click the downloaded PKC file and then just follow the onscreen instructions.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.780
If you're a Linux user you can just go ahead and download the installer and then just use the bash line

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.980
in your terminal to actually install everything you need.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.520
OK so go ahead and click on the installer download it.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.270
Follow the instructions but just double click.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.460
Being that it's executable file and everything should be working for you.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.240
Keep in mind this is quite a large installation.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.730
It's about 350 megabytes but that's also because it includes all the packages were going to be using

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.080
throughout this course so once you install this you won't have to continually install the packages so

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.420
I understand that it's a pretty large download.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.140
There's also something called mini anti-commie you can use but I would still recommend that you just

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.300
download the full package environment.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.930
That way you don't have to continually install stuff as you go throughout the course.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.360
Once you went ahead and downloaded and just followed the onscreen onscreen instructions for the installer

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.030
you'll go ahead and on the windows computer you can just come to your start.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.260
Type in C and D.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.000
This will be your command prompt and that will bring up this sort of command prompt here and what you're

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.160
going to go ahead and do it.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.430
Taipan J U P Y C E R.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.180
Space notebook.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.860
If you're a Mac OS you're going to do the exact same thing except instead of command prompt.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.670
You're going to do this on your terminal.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.350
You'll just do a spotlight search for the word terminal.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.760
TR am I an AOL.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.170
You'll get a very similar environment or pop up that looks like this.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.000
It'll probably be an all white instead of a black background.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.650
You'll do the exact same thing all Taipan Jupiter space notebook.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:51.810
Hit enter and then in your browser you'll actually get a window or new tab to pop up and the new tab

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:58.530
will look something like this will be at local hosts either 8000 or a slash tree and then you can go

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.150
ahead and click here on NEW and you'll get some options for notebook.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.770
Most likely you won't have as many options as I do here.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.380
You'll either have something that says Python roots or Python 3 whatever it says.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.080
That's OK you can just go out and click on one of these options and you should get a Jupiter notebook

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:24.170
if you can go ahead and just type in print and in print see say hello and then click here on.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.780
Run the cell.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.060
You should be good to go if that outputs.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.160
Hello.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.740
OK.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.710
Coming up next we're going to give you more background on how to use the Jupiter notebook as a development

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.800
environment and later on we'll show you some other options as well for other ideas.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.470
In case you want to use something that's not Jupiter notebook.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.100
All right.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.710
Feel free to post any questions over the installation process to the Q&A forums and I'll be happy to

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.850
help you out.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.770
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
